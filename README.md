OVERVIEW

This project involves developing a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on various factors, such as plot, cast, and directors. The system utilizes the cosine similarity metric to assess the likeness between movies in the database. An interactive webpage, built with Streamlit, allows users to input the title of a movie they enjoy, and the system then presents the top 5 recommendations based on the calculated similarities.
